<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 21, 2026</p>

<p>Stick Golf ("we," "our," or "the App") is a golf scorekeeper and betting tracker for iOS. This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Account Information</h3>
<p>When you sign in with Google or Apple, we receive:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your name</li>
  <li>Your email address</li>
  <li>Your profile picture (if available from your sign-in provider)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use the App without signing in. In that case, we identify your device using an anonymous device identifier generated locally on your phone.</p>

<h3>Golf Data</h3>
<p>When you use the App, we store:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Round information (course played, date, players in the group)</li>
  <li>Hole-by-hole scores and putt counts</li>
  <li>Betting game configurations and results</li>
  <li>Settlement calculations (who owes whom)</li>
  <li>Your preferences (handicap index, preferred tee box, avatar color)</li>
  <li>Players you've recently played with (for quick re-selection)</li>
  <li>Courses you've recently played</li>
</ul>

<h3>Device Information</h3>
<p>We generate and store a random unique identifier on your device. This identifier is used to associate your rounds and data with your device, enable multi-device sync, and support anonymous usage before sign-in. We do not collect your device model, operating system version, or other hardware identifiers for tracking purposes.</p>

<h3>Location Data (Optional)</h3>
<p>If you choose to search for nearby golf courses, we request access to your device's location. This data is used only in real-time to find courses near you and is not stored on our servers. You can deny this permission and search for courses by name instead.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>If you submit feedback through the App, we collect your message, the feedback category you select, and basic context (app version, platform, which screen you were on). If you are signed in, your name may be associated with the feedback.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>We use your information to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide the core scorekeeper and betting tracker functionality</li>
  <li>Save your rounds, preferences, and game history</li>
  <li>Enable multiplayer features (inviting others to follow a round in real time)</li>
  <li>Calculate betting settlements accurately</li>
  <li>Diagnose and fix errors and crashes</li>
  <li>Respond to your feedback and support requests</li>
  <li>Process your subscription (when applicable)</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>The App uses the following third-party services. Each operates under its own privacy policy:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Service</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
    <th>Data Shared</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Clerk</strong></td>
    <td>Authentication (Google/Apple sign-in)</td>
    <td>Name, email, profile picture</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Convex</strong></td>
    <td>Cloud database</td>
    <td>All App data (rounds, scores, user profiles)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Sentry</strong></td>
    <td>Error and crash monitoring</td>
    <td>Error messages, stack traces, device identifier, screen context</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>RevenueCat</strong></td>
    <td>Subscription management</td>
    <td>App user ID, purchase tokens from Apple</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>GolfCourseAPI</strong></td>
    <td>Golf course data (hole info, ratings)</td>
    <td>Search queries (course names or locations)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>We do not use any advertising networks, analytics SDKs, or behavioral tracking tools.</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>

<p>We do <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sell your personal information to anyone</li>
  <li>Share your data with advertisers</li>
  <li>Use your data for purposes unrelated to the App</li>
</ul>

<p>We may share data in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>With other players in your round.</strong> When you create or join a round, the other participants can see player names, handicaps, scores, and settlement results for that round.</li>
  <li><strong>With our service providers.</strong> The third-party services listed above process data on our behalf to operate the App.</li>
  <li><strong>If required by law.</strong> We may disclose information if required by a valid legal process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

<p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active. Completed rounds are kept indefinitely so you can review your history. If you delete your account, all your data is permanently removed (see Section 7).</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>

<p>Your data is stored securely in Convex, a cloud database with industry-standard security practices. Authentication tokens are stored in your device's secure storage. All data transmitted between the App and our servers is encrypted in transit using HTTPS.</p>

<p>No method of electronic storage is 100% secure, but we take reasonable measures to protect your information.</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

<h3>Delete Your Account</h3>
<p>You can permanently delete your account and all associated data directly within the App. Go to Settings and tap "Delete Account." This will remove your user profile, all rounds you created, player connections, course history, saved game configurations, feedback submissions, and device mappings. This action cannot be undone.</p>

<h3>Location Permission</h3>
<p>You can grant or revoke location access at any time through your device's Settings. The App works fully without location access.</p>

<h3>Sign Out</h3>
<p>You can sign out at any time from the Settings screen. Your data remains stored and will be available when you sign back in.</p>

<h3>Contact Us</h3>
<p>For any questions about your data or to request information about what we store, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@stickapp.golf" class="contact-email">support@stickapp.golf</a>.</p>

<h2>8. Betting and Financial Data</h2>

<p>Stick Golf is a scorekeeper that tracks friendly wagers between players. The App calculates who owes whom based on the betting games you configure. <strong>No real money is exchanged through the App.</strong> We do not process payments between players, and we have no access to your bank account, credit card, or payment apps. Settlement amounts are informational only.</p>

<p>Subscription payments for the App itself are handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We never see or store your payment card information.</p>

<h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>Stick Golf is intended for users aged 17 and older. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 17. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we make significant changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

<h2>11. Contact</h2>

<p>For questions about this privacy policy or your data, contact:</p>
