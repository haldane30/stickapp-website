## Market Context

- **48.1 million Americans** played golf in 2025 — 8 consecutive years of growth, 50% increase over the past decade
- **83% of regular golfers** enjoy on-course betting games
- **75%+ of core golfers** (8+ rounds/year) have at least one golf app
- **41-44% of golf app users pay** for premium features (Hole19 data) — dramatically above the 2-5% industry average for apps
- Golf attracts a high-income demographic willing to pay for tools
- Female golfers up 58% since 2019 — market is diversifying

**Key insight:** Nobody has won the golf betting app market yet. It's fragmented, with most apps having mediocre UX and shallow game implementations.

## Direct Competitors (Betting-Focused Apps)

### Skins App — Primary Competitor

| | Details |
|--|---------|
| **Price** | $40/yr (Skins game always free; 2 free rounds of any game) |
| **Games** | 13+ (Skins, Nassau, Banker, Vegas, Quota, Hammer, Wolf, Match Play, etc.) |
| **Platforms** | iOS and Android |
| **Strengths** | Troon partnership (900+ properties, 45+ countries), Golf.com and MyGolfSpy coverage, GPS course detection, Venmo/CashApp/PayPal/Zelle settlement links |
| **Weaknesses** | Handicap input has no decimal point (forces rounding), 2-round free trial is aggressive, no evidence of strong social/viral features beyond join codes |
| **Model** | One scorekeeper, others optionally join with 4-digit code |
| **Founded** | 2023 by Stanford engineers Mike Oristian and James Gillmore |

**Our edge over Skins:**
- 1,017 tests with zero-sum verification vs their calculation errors
- One score entry feeds all games simultaneously
- Real-time multi-device sync (not just one scorekeeper)
- Press-the-press chains with deep configurability
- Designer-built UI vs engineer-built UI
- We charge $59.99/yr because we're the better product

### Beezer Golf

| | Details |
|--|---------|
| **Price** | $3.99/mo, $19.99/6mo, $29.99/yr |
| **Games** | ~30 (largest game library) |
| **Free tier** | None — instant paywall after login |
| **Rating** | 4.7 stars (496 ratings) |
| **Strengths** | "Beezer Bank" running balance tracker, interactive scorecard, largest game count |
| **Weaknesses** | **No free tier kills viral growth** — users delete immediately. 6-player limit. Nassau press display issues. Apple Watch GPS delays. |

**Cautionary tale:** Beezer proves that no free tier = terrible first impression. Users can't even see a scorecard without paying. Don't do this.

### Golf Bettor

| | Details |
|--|---------|
| **Price** | $9.99/yr (60-day free trial) |
| **Games** | 12 formats, 65 configurations |
| **Strengths** | Most generous free trial (60 days). Cheapest annual price. 18,000 courses. "Game Viewer Mode" for spectators. Venmo integration. |
| **Weaknesses** | Dated UI. Low brand awareness. No evidence of active development or partnerships. US/Canada only. |

**Takeaway:** $9.99/yr is so cheap it signals "basic tool." Don't compete on price — compete on quality.

### 18 Birdies

| | Details |
|--|---------|
| **Price** | $7.99/week, $19.99/mo, $99.99/yr (7-day free trial) |
| **Games** | 10 (Sixes, Skins, Wolf, Match Play, Points, Nassau, Vegas, Dots, Rolling Stroke, Targets) |
| **Free tier** | GPS, scoring, stat tracking, Skins & Points free |
| **Strengths** | Massive user base. Strong brand. GPS/analytics/club recommendations. |
| **Weaknesses** | Betting is a side feature, not the focus. Nassau/Wolf locked behind $100/yr paywall. Expensive for betting-only users. |

**Not a direct competitor** — they're a GPS/analytics app that happens to have betting. But their users might discover us when frustrated that Wolf costs $100/yr.

---

### GolfApp.com

| | Details |
|--|---------|
| **Price** | Free (premium coming) |
| **Games** | Nassau, Skins, Nine Point, Wolf, Hi/Low, Closeout, 7 Point, Match Play, Stroke Play |
| **Strengths** | Currently free (land grab). "Mayhem" custom prop bets (unique). Social/live betting from afar. SEO-friendly name. |
| **Weaknesses** | Revenue model unclear. Free won't last — will they lose users when they start charging? |

**Watch this one.** Their "Mayhem" prop bet feature is genuinely interesting and differentiated.

---

### Loop Golf (Easy Money Golf Club)

| | Details |
|--|---------|
| **Price** | Free to download; links debit card, moves real money |
| **Games** | Match Play (expanding) |
| **Strengths** | Solves settlement completely — money moves automatically. No chasing Venmo. |
| **Weaknesses** | Requires linking a debit card (high friction, trust barrier). $10 minimum bet excludes casual games. Regulatory complexity. |

**Different category entirely.** They're a payment app disguised as golf. We're a golf app that might eventually integrate payments.

---

### Others Worth Tracking

| App | Price | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| **Press Golf** | Unknown | Wolf, Nassau, Skins, Snake, Banker. Auto-press and payout math. PayPal/Venmo settlement. |
| **Unknown Golf** | Free / Unknown+ tier | Venmo settlement integration. Tournament-focused. |
| **Antee** | Unknown | Live leaderboards. Explicitly no real currency transfer. |
| **iBet Golfing** | $4.99-6.99/mo or $35.99-64.99/yr | Higher price point. Betting combos. |

## Where Stick Wins

1. **Accuracy** — 1,017 tests, zero-sum verification. When money's on the line, correctness matters.
2. **Multi-game rounds** — One score entry feeds all games. Nobody else does this cleanly.
3. **Press depth** — Auto-press, press-the-press chains, configurable limits. Competitors get this wrong or skip it.
4. **Real-time sync** — Convex reactive backend, <2s updates to all viewers.
5. **Design quality** — Built by a designer, not just engineers.
6. **Viewer experience** — Non-scorekeepers are first-class citizens, not afterthoughts.
7. **Generous free tier** — 3 full rounds + capable free tier, not a 2-round gate or instant paywall.

## Where Competitors Win (For Now)

1. **Skins App** — Troon partnership gives distribution at 900+ properties. Media coverage in Golf.com, MyGolfSpy.
2. **Beezer** — 30 games vs our 9. Quantity, even if not quality.
3. **18 Birdies** — GPS + analytics + betting in one app. Massive existing user base.
4. **GolfApp** — Currently free. "Mayhem" prop bets are creative.
5. **Loop Golf** — Actual money settlement (we don't have this yet).
6. **Golf Bettor** — 60-day free trial is very generous.
