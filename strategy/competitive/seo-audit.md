## Competitor Content Audit

### Beezer Golf (Primary SEO Threat)

| Metric | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Domain age** | ~3 years | Head start on domain authority |
| **Game guide pages** | ~30 | Many thin (300-500 words) |
| **Blog posts** | ~15-20 | Infrequent, mixed quality |
| **URL structure** | `/golf-betting-games/[game]-game-rules` | Longer than ours |
| **Content depth** | Thin | No settlement examples, no strategy tips |
| **Structured data** | Unknown | Need to audit |
| **Internal linking** | Weak | Games don't cross-link well |
| **Backlink profile** | Moderate | Some golf blog mentions |

**How we beat them:** Every game guide goes 3-5x deeper. Real settlement math. Strategy tips. FAQ sections with structured data. Better internal linking via hub-and-spoke.

### Skins App (No SEO Threat)

| Metric | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Blog presence** | Lifestyle fluff | "We went golfing in Red Rocks" |
| **Game guide pages** | None | Zero educational content |
| **SEO strategy** | None evident | Not competing on content |

### 18 Birdies (Passive SEO)

| Metric | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Rankings** | Some support docs rank | "dots golf game," "side games" |
| **Strategy** | None for betting content | GPS/scoring is their focus |
| **Threat level** | Low | Not actively competing |
