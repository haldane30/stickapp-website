# Stick Golf — Voice & Tone Guide

> For all written content: website, blog, game guides, social media, App Store listing, email, everything.

## The Voice in One Sentence

Stick sounds like the member at the club who knows every game inside out — not because they studied it, but because they've played them all and can explain the nuances over a drink.

---

## Voice Attributes

### Authoritative
We know these games. We built calculators that handle every edge case. We've verified the math 1,448 times. When we say "this is how Nassau presses work," it's because we've coded, tested, and verified every scenario.

**Do:** State things with confidence. Use specific numbers and examples.
**Don't:** Hedge with "we think" or "it might be." If you're not sure, research it. Don't publish uncertainty.

### Approachable
We write for the golfer who plays every Saturday, not the rules committee. We use real names in examples ("Marcus birdies the 7th"), not "Player A." We explain jargon the first time we use it.

**Do:** Use conversational language. Explain terms naturally. Write like you're talking to a friend.
**Don't:** Dumb things down. Our audience is smart — they just might not know the specifics of how a press chain settles.

### Precise
Numbers are right. Always. When we show a settlement example, the math checks out. When we say "zero-sum verified," we mean it literally — every dollar won equals every dollar lost.

**Do:** Show the actual math. Use real numbers. Double-check everything.
**Don't:** Round, approximate, or handwave. If a settlement is $24.50, say $24.50, not "about $25."

### Confident
We charge more than most competitors because we're better. We don't apologize for that. We don't trash competitors — we just show what we do and let the quality speak.

**Do:** State what makes Stick different. Be direct about strengths.
**Don't:** Be arrogant. Never trash-talk competitors by name. Never say "unlike [Competitor] which sucks." Instead: "Stick handles press chains automatically — no manual tracking needed."

### Warm
We love this game. We love the culture around it — the bets, the trash talk, the 19th hole settlement. The writing should feel like it comes from someone who genuinely enjoys golf, not someone writing marketing copy about golf.

**Do:** Let personality come through. Reference real golf culture (the group chat, the Saturday morning tee time, the argument about who pressed when).
**Don't:** Be sentimental or nostalgic for its own sake. No "golf is a beautiful journey of the soul." We're practical people who like to play and bet.

## Tone Adjustments by Context

The voice stays the same. The tone adjusts:

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Game guides** | Authoritative teacher | "Nassau is three separate bets: front nine, back nine, and overall. Here's how each one works." |
| **Blog posts (strategy)** | Knowledgeable friend | "Here's the thing about pressing when you're 2-down on 15: the math says it's almost always worth it." |
| **Blog posts (lifestyle)** | Relatable storyteller | "Every group has the guy who announces his press before he's even teed off." |
| **App Store listing** | Confident pitch | "Track every golf money game in one app. The math is always right." |
| **Error messages / support** | Helpful and human | "Something went wrong calculating that settlement. We're looking into it." |
| **Social media** | Casual, playful | "Your buddy says he pressed on 16. He did not press on 16." |

## Writing Rules

### Do
- Use contractions (it's, don't, you'll)
- Use "you" and "your" — speak directly to the reader
- Use named players in examples (Marcus, Sarah, Dev, Pam — our standard cast)
- Show real math and real numbers
- Include the "why" — don't just explain rules, explain why they matter
- Front-load the important information (inverted pyramid)
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max for web)
- Include a clear CTA but make it feel natural, not pushy

### Don't
- Use corporate speak ("leverage," "utilize," "functionality," "solution")
- Use passive voice when active is clearer ("the bet was won" → "Marcus won the bet")
- Use exclamation points more than once per piece (they lose impact)
- Start sentences with "At Stick, we..." more than once per page
- Use the word "simply" (it's condescending — if it were simple, they wouldn't be reading a guide)
- Write "click here" as link text (use descriptive links)
- Use gendered language for hypothetical golfers (mix it up, use all names)

## Standard Example Players

Use these names in game guide examples and settlement walkthroughs for consistency:

| Name | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Marcus** | Low handicapper (5). Steady. Makes smart presses. |
| **Sarah** | Mid handicapper (12). Aggressive player. Goes for it. |
| **Dev** | Higher handicapper (20). Improving. Gets value from net scoring. |
| **Pam** | Higher handicapper (28). New to betting games. The audience surrogate. |

These aren't personas for the app — they're recurring characters in our content who make settlement examples feel real instead of abstract.

## Formatting Conventions

### Headlines
- Game guide H1: "[Game Name]: The Complete Guide to Rules, Scoring & Settlement"
- Blog H1: Conversational, keyword-forward, under 65 characters
- Section headings: Clear and scannable (someone skimming should get the gist)

### Numbers
- Spell out one through nine, use digits for 10+
- Always use digits for money ($5, not five dollars)
- Always use digits for scores, handicaps, and hole numbers

### Golf Terminology
- First mention: explain it. "A press (a new bet that starts mid-round)..."
- After that: use freely without explanation
- Never assume the reader knows: stroke index, dormie, nassau, press, carry

### Competitor References
- In the "Best Golf Betting Apps" comparison: be honest and fair. Name them, describe what they do well, explain where Stick differs.
- In game guides and other content: never name competitors. Just be the best resource.
- Never: trash-talk, be dismissive, or claim competitors "don't work"

## The Litmus Test

Before publishing anything, ask:

1. **Would a golfer share this?** If not, it's not interesting enough.
2. **Does it teach something?** Every piece should leave the reader knowing more than before.
3. **Is the math right?** If there are numbers, verify them.
4. **Would I read this?** If it's boring, rewrite it.
5. **Does it respect the reader's time?** Get to the point. No throat-clearing paragraphs.
