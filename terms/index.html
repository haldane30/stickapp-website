<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 21, 2026</p>

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Stick Golf ("the App"), a golf scorekeeper and betting tracker for iOS. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

<h2>1. Description of Service</h2>

<p>Stick Golf is a mobile application that helps golfers keep score and track friendly wagers during rounds of golf. The App supports multiple betting game formats (Nassau, Skins, Wolf, and others), calculates settlements, and provides real-time scoring for groups.</p>

<p><strong>Stick Golf is a scorekeeper, not a gambling platform.</strong> The App calculates who owes whom based on games you configure with your group. No real money is exchanged through the App. Any financial settlements between players happen outside the App and are solely between the players involved.</p>

<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>

<p>You must be at least 17 years old to use the App. By using the App, you represent that you meet this age requirement.</p>

<h2>3. Accounts</h2>

<p>You can use limited features of the App without creating an account. To access full functionality, you may sign in using Google or Apple. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your sign-in credentials.</p>

<p>You may delete your account at any time through the App's Settings. Deletion is permanent and removes all your data, including rounds, player connections, and course history.</p>

<h2>4. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>

<h3>Free Trial</h3>
<p>New users receive a free trial that includes full access to all App features. The trial is limited by number of rounds created, not by time.</p>

<h3>Paid Subscription</h3>
<p>After the trial period, continued use of the App requires a paid subscription. Subscriptions are billed through Apple's App Store. By subscribing, you agree to Apple's payment terms.</p>

<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>Current subscription prices are displayed in the App before purchase. Prices may change, but changes will not affect your current billing period.</p>

<h3>Cancellation</h3>
<p>You can cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. No refunds are provided for partial billing periods. Refund requests should be directed to Apple.</p>

<h3>Invited Rounds</h3>
<p>Joining a round created by another user (as a viewer) does not count against your trial or require a subscription.</p>

<h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>

<p>You agree not to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose, including illegal gambling where prohibited by your jurisdiction</li>
  <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to other users' data or accounts</li>
  <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App's infrastructure</li>
  <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
  <li>Use the App to transmit harmful, offensive, or abusive content through feedback or player names</li>
  <li>Create multiple accounts to circumvent the trial or subscription requirements</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Betting and Wagering Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Stick Golf provides tools to calculate the results of common golf betting games. <strong>The App does not facilitate, process, or intermediate any financial transactions between users.</strong></p>

<p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determining whether friendly wagering is legal in your jurisdiction</li>
  <li>Any money exchanged between you and other players outside the App</li>
  <li>The accuracy of scores entered into the App</li>
  <li>Agreeing to the terms of any bets with your playing partners before starting a round</li>
</ul>

<p>We are not a gambling operator, bookmaker, or financial intermediary. We take no commission and have no involvement in any money exchanged between players.</p>

<h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>The App, including its design, code, game calculation engines, and content, is owned by Stick Golf and protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes.</p>

<p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the App or its content.</p>

<h2>8. User Content</h2>

<p>You retain ownership of data you enter into the App (scores, player names, feedback). By using the App, you grant us a license to store and process this data to provide the service.</p>

<p>You are responsible for ensuring that player names and feedback you submit do not infringe on others' rights or contain harmful content.</p>

<h2>9. Data and Privacy</h2>

<p>Your use of the App is also governed by our <a href="https://stickapp.golf/privacy" class="contact-email">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

<h2>10. Accuracy of Calculations</h2>

<p>We strive to ensure all game calculations and settlements are accurate. Our calculation engine is extensively tested. However, we do not guarantee that calculations will be error-free in all circumstances.</p>

<p>If you believe a calculation is incorrect, please report it through the App's feedback feature. You should always verify settlement amounts with your playing partners before exchanging any money.</p>

<h2>11. Availability</h2>

<p>We aim to keep the App available and reliable, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The App may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, or circumstances beyond our control. The App includes offline functionality so you can continue scoring even without an internet connection.</p>

<h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Stick Golf and its operator shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App. This includes, but is not limited to, any losses from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inaccurate calculations or settlement amounts</li>
  <li>Money exchanged between players based on App results</li>
  <li>Loss of data due to technical failures</li>
  <li>Service interruptions or downtime</li>
</ul>

<p>Our total liability for any claim related to the App shall not exceed the amount you paid for the App in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

<h2>13. Indemnification</h2>

<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Stick Golf and its operator from any claims, damages, or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or any bets or financial arrangements you make with other players.</p>

<h2>14. Termination</h2>

<p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App if you violate these Terms. You may stop using the App at any time. Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases, but provisions that should survive (liability, indemnification, disputes) will remain in effect.</p>

<h2>15. Changes to These Terms</h2>

<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we make significant changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

<h2>16. Governing Law</h2>

<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Arizona, United States, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of Arizona.</p>

<h2>17. Severability</h2>

<p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

<h2>18. Entire Agreement</h2>

<p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Stick Golf regarding your use of the App.</p>

<h2>19. Contact</h2>
